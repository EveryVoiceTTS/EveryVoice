This is the Text-to-Speech (TTS) toolkit used by the Small Teams "Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education" project.

## Quickstart

### Install conda

First, you'll need to install `conda`. [Miniforge3](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) is a fully open-source option which is free for all users and works well. You can also use Anaconda3 or Miniconda3 if you have or can get a license.

### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/EveryVoiceTTS/EveryVoice.git
cd EveryVoice
git submodule update --init
```

### Environment and installation â€“ automated

To run EveryVoice, you need to create a new environment using Conda and Python 3.10, install all our dependencies and EveryVoice itself.

We have automated the procedure required to do all this in the script `make-everyvoice-env`, which you can run like this:

```sh
./make-everyvoice-env --name <env-name-of-your-choice>
conda activate <env-name-of-your-choice>
```

Add the option `--cuda CUDA_VERSION` if you need to override the default CUDA version, or `--cpu` to use Torch compiled for CPU use only.

### Environment and installation â€“ manual

If the automated installation process does not work for you, or if you prefer to do the full installation manually, please refer to [EveryVoice / Installation](https://docs.everyvoice.ca/latest/install/#manual-installation).

### Documentation

Read the full [EveryVoice documentation](https://docs.everyvoice.ca/).

In particular, read the [Guides](https://docs.everyvoice.ca/latest/guides/) to get familiar with the whole process.
