As a consequence of the residential school system and other policies of cultural suppression, the majority of these languages now have fewer than 500 fluent speakers remaining, most of them elderly.</p> <p>Despite this, Indigenous people have resisted colonial policies and continued speaking their languages, with interest by students and parents in Indigenous language education continuing to grow. Teachers are often overwhelmed by the number of students, and the trend towards online education means many students who have not previously had access to language classes now do. Supporting these growing cohorts of students comes with unique challenges in languages with few fluent first-language speakers. Teachers are particularly concerned with providing their students with opportunities to hear the language outside of class.</p> <p>While there is no replacement for a speaker of an Indigenous language, there are possible applications for speech synthesis (text-to-speech) to supplement existing text-based tools like verb conjugators, dictionaries and phrasebooks.</p> <p>The National Research Council has partnered with the Onkwawenna Kentyohkwa Kanyen\u2019k\u00e9ha immersion school, W\u0331S\u00c1NE\u0106 School Board, University nuhelot\u2019\u012fne thaiyots\u2019\u012f nistameyim\u00e2kanak Blue Quills, and the University of Edinburgh to research and develop state-of-the-art speech synthesis (text-to-speech) systems and techniques for Indigenous languages in Canada, with a focus on how to integrate text-to-speech technology into the classroom.</p> <p>The project is titled Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education (SGILE).</p> <p>More information and motivation for this project can be found in our ACL2022 paper</p>"},{"location":"start/#what-is-everyvoice-and-this-documentation-about","title":"What is EveryVoice and this documentation about?","text":"<p>This project is the location of active research and development for the Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education project.

This means we expect that your language might have inputs that consist of more than one symbol, like \"kw\" or \"tl\".</li> <li>We support out-of-the-box integration with g2p which allows the g2p rules for 30+ Indigenous languages to be used in the project.</li> <li>We implement the use of multi-hot phonological feature vector inputs for easier pre-training/fine-tuning. We implement this using the panphon library.</li> <li>We will not try to implement many different models.

It's not ethical to just use audio you find somewhere if it doesn't have explicit permission to use it for the purposes of text-to-speech.

If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry, we can ensure the right format in later steps. It's best if your audio clips are somewhere between half a second and 10 seconds long. Any longer and it could be difficult to train. If your audio is longer than this, we suggest processing it into smaller chunks first.</p> <p>Your text should be consistently written and should be in a pipe-separated values spreadsheet, similar to this file. It should have a column that contains text and a column that contains the <code>basename</code> of your associated audio file. So if you have a recording of somebody saying \"hello how are you?\" and the corresponding audio is called <code>mydata0001.wav</code> then you should have a psv file that looks like this:</p> <pre><code>basename|text\nmydata0001|hello how are you?\nmydata0002|some other sentence.\n...\n</code></pre> <p>We also support comma and tab separated files, but recommend using pipes (|).</p> <p>You can also use the \"festival\" format which is like this (example from Sinhala TTS):</p> <pre><code>( sin_2241_0329430812 \" \u0d9a\u0ddd\u0d9a\u0da7\u0dad\u0dca \u0db8\u0d82 \u0dc0\u0dd9\u0db1\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dad\u0dbb\u0db8\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dd9 \u0d9c\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dd0\u0dad\u0dd2\u0dc0 \u0d87\u0db3 \u0d9c\u0dad\u0dca\u0dad\u0dcf \" )\n( sin_2241_0598895166 \" \u0d87\u0db1\u0dca\u0da2\u0dbd\u0dd3\u0db1\u0dcf \u0da2\u0ddc\u0dbd\u0dd3 \u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dba\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0db4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0d9c\u0dd2\u0dba \u0daf\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dc0\u0dbd \u0db6\u0ddc\u0dc4\u0ddd \u0dc3\u0dd9\u0dba\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9a\u0dad\u0dcf \u0db6\u0dc4\u0da7 \u0dbd\u0d9a\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd6 \u0da0\u0dbb\u0dd2\u0dad\u0dba\u0d9a\u0dca \" )\n( sin_2241_0701577369 \" \u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dae\u0dd2\u0d9a \u0da0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0dad\u0db1\u0dba \u0dc4\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db8\u0dcf\u0da2\u0dd3\u0dba \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0d87\u0dad\u0dd2 \u0d9a\u0dc5 \u0dc4\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dd4\u0dba\u0dda \u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dbd \u0d86\u0dbb\u0dca\u0dae\u0dd2\u0d9a \u0daf\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0dab\u0dd4\u0dc0 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dc3\u0dcf \u0daf\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca\u0dba \" )\n( sin_2241_0715400935 \" \u0d89\u0db1\u0dca \u0d85\u0daf\u0dc4\u0dc3\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0dda \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0dad\u0dca\u0db8\u0d9a \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dd2\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd3\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dad\u0ddc\u0dbb \u0db6\u0dd0\u0dbd\u0dca\u0db8\u0dba\u0dd2 \" )\n( sin_2241_0817100025 \" \u0d85\u0db4 \u0dba\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dca\u0db0\u0dba\u0dda \u0db4\u0dc5\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dc0\u0dbb\u0dda\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db8 \u0db4\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0daf \u0dc0\u0dd3 \u0d85\u0dc0\u0dc3\u0dcf\u0db1\u0dba \" )\n</code></pre> <p>In this format, there are corresponding wav files labelled sin_2241_0329430812.wav etc..</p>"},{"location":"guides/custom/#step-3-install-everyvoice","title":"Step 3: Install EveryVoice","text":"<p>Head over to the install documentation and install EveryVoice</p>"},{"location":"guides/custom/#step-4-run-the-new-dataset-wizard","title":"Step 4: Run the New Dataset Wizard \ud83e\uddd9","text":"<p>Once you have your data, the best thing to do is to run the New Dataset Wizard \ud83e\uddd9.
