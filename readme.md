This is an implementation of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) model used by the Small Teams "Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education" project.

It is largely based off the FastSpeech2/Fastpitch models.

## Quickstart

### Install

Clone clone the repo and pip install it locally:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/EveryVoice.git
$ cd EveryVoice
$ git submodule update --init
$ python -m pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies

I recommend using Conda and Python 3.9. To do that, create a new environment:

```
conda create --name EveryVoice python=3.9
conda activate EveryVoice
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

You can then install the rest of the Python dependencies with pip

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Alternatively, you can just create the whole thing from our `environment.yml` file:

```
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate EveryVoice
```
