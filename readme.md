This is an implementation of the Text-to-Speech (TTS) model used by the Small Teams "Speech Generation for Indigenous Language Education" project.

It is largely based off the FastSpeech2/Fastpitch models.

## Quickstart

### Environment
We recommend using Conda and Python 3.9. To do that, create a new environment:

```sh
conda create --name EveryVoice python=3.9
conda activate EveryVoice
pip \
  install \
    torch==1.13.1+cu117 \
    torchaudio==0.13.1 \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu117
```

### Install

Clone the repository and `pip` install it locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/roedoejet/EveryVoice.git
cd EveryVoice
git submodule update --init
pip install -e .
```

### Documentation

Read the full [EveryVoice documentation](https://docs.everyvoice.ca/).

In particular, read the [Guides](https://docs.everyvoice.ca/guides/index.html) to get familiar with the whole process.
