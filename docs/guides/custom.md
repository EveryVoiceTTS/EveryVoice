# Customize to your language

## Step 1: Make sure you have Permission!

So, you want to build a text-to-speech system for a new language or dataset - cool! But, just because you **can** build a text-to-speech system, doesn't mean you **should**. There are a lot of tricky ethical
questions around text-to-speech. It's not ethical to just use audio you find somewhere if it doesn't have explicit permission to use it for the purposes of text-to-speech. The first step is to make sure you have
permission to use the data in question and that whoever contributed their voice to the data you want to use is aware and supportive of your goal.

## Step 2: Gather Your Data

The first thing to do is to get all the data you have (in this case audio with text transcripts) together in one place. Your audio should be in 'wav' format. Ideally it would be 16bit, mono (one channel) audio sampled somewhere between 22.05kHz and 48kHz. If that doesn't mean anything to you, don't worry, we can ensure the right format in later steps.
It's best if your audio clips are somewhere between half a second and 10 seconds long. Any longer and it could be difficult to train. If your audio is longer than this, we suggest processing it into smaller chunks first.

Your text should be consistently written and should be in a pipe-separated values spreadsheet, similar to [this file](https://github.com/roedoejet/EveryVoice/blob/main/everyvoice/filelists/lj_full.psv). It should have a column that contains text and a column that contains the `basename` of your associated audio file. So if you have a recording of somebody saying "hello how are you?" and the corresponding audio is called `mydata0001.wav`
then you should have a psv file that looks like this:

```csv hl_lines="2"

basename|text
mydata0001|hello how are you?
mydata0002|some other sentence.
...
```

We also support comma and tab separated files, but recommend using pipes (|).

You can also use the "festival" format which is like this (example from [Sinhala TTS](https://openslr.org/30/)):

```text

```

In this format, there are corresponding wav files labelled sin_2241_0329430812.wav etc..

## Step 3: Install EveryVoice

Head over to the [install documentation](../install.md) and install EveryVoice

## Step 4: Run the New Dataset Wizard üßô

Once you have your data, the best thing to do is to run the New Dataset Wizard üßô. To do that run:

```bash
everyvoice new-dataset
```

After running the new-dataset wizard, cd into your newly created directory. Let's call it `test` for now.

```bash
cd test
```

## Step 5: Run the Preprocessor

Your models need to do a number of preprocessing steps in order to prepare for training. To preprocess everything you need, run the following:

```bash
everyvoice preprocess -p config/feature_prediction.yaml
```

## Step 6: Train your Vocoder

```bash
everyvoice train spec-to-wav -p config/vocoder.yaml
```

By default, we run our training with PyTorch Lightning's "auto" strategy. But, if you are on a machine where you know the hardware, you can specify it like:

```bash
everyvoice train spec-to-wav -p config/vocoder.yaml -d 1 -a gpu
```

Which would use the GPU accelerator and specify 1 device/chip.

## Step 7: Train your Feature Prediction Network

To generate audio when you train your feature prediction network, you need to add your vocoder checkpoint to the `config/feature_prediction.yaml`

At the bottom of that file you'll find a key called vocoder_path. Add the absolute path to your trained vocder (here it would be `/path/to/test/logs_and_checkpoints/VocoderExperiment/base/checkpoints/last.ckpt` where `/path/to` would be the actual path to it on your computer.)

Once you've replaced the vocoder_path key, you can train your feature prediction network:

```bash
everyvoice train text-to-spec -p config/feature_prediction.yaml
```

## Step 8: Synthesize Speech in Your Language!

You can synthesize by pointing the CLI to your trained feature prediction network and passing in the text. You can export to wav, npy, or pt files.

```bash
everyvoice synthesize text-to-wav logs_and_checkpoints/FeaturePredictionExperiment/base/checkpoints/last.ckpt -t "‡∂∏‡∑ô‡∂Ø‡∑è ‡∑É‡∑ê‡∂ª‡∑ö ‡∑É‡∑è‡∂ö‡∂†‡∑ä‡∂°‡∑è‡∑Ä‡∂ö‡∑ä ‡∑Ä‡∑í‡∂Ø‡∑í‡∂∫‡∂ß ‡∂±‡∑ô‡∑Ä‡∑ô‡∂∫‡∑í ‡∂±‡∑ö‡∂Ø ‡∂¥‡∂Ω ‡∂ö‡∂ª‡∂Ω ‡∂≠‡∑í‡∂∫‡∑ô‡∂±‡∑ä‡∂±‡∑ô" -a gpu -d 1
```
